    "# Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "# Ans :-\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception :- In Python, an exception is an abnormal event or error that occurs during the execution of a program.\n",
    "# When an exceptional condition arises that disrupts the normal flow of a program, Python generates an \n",
    "# exception object. This exception object contains information about the error, such as its type and a \n",
    "# description of what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors in Python, but they occur at different stages of program \n",
    "# execution and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 1.Nature of Error:\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Syntax Error: Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the Python interpreter encounters \n",
    "#     code that violates the language's grammar rules. These errors occur during the parsing phase, before the \n",
    "#     program starts executing. Syntax errors typically involve issues like missing colons, unmatched parentheses, \n",
    "#     or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Exception: Exceptions, on the other hand, are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a Python program. \n",
    "#     They are typically caused by exceptional conditions or unexpected events, such as division by zero, trying to access \n",
    "#     an index that doesn't exist, or attempting to open a non-existent file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# 2.Occurrence:\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected and reported by the Python interpreter before the program begins executing. \n",
    "#     The program won't run until these syntax errors are fixed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Exception: Exceptions occur during program execution, so the program runs but may encounter exceptions when certain \n",
    "#     conditions are met.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 3.Handling:\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Syntax Error: Syntax errors must be fixed in the code before you can run the program. They do not have built-in \n",
    "#     mechanisms for handling; you must correct the code structure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Exception: Exceptions can be handled using try...except blocks. You can write code to gracefully handle exceptions, \n",
    "#     allowing the program to continue running even in the presence of errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 4.Debugging:\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Syntax Error: Syntax errors are relatively easy to debug because the interpreter points to the exact location \n",
    "#     in the code where the error occurred, making it clear what needs to be fixed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#     Exception: Debugging exceptions can be more challenging because the error may occur deeper within the code.\n",
    "#     Using try...except blocks and logging can help identify the cause of exceptions."

    "# Q5.What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "# Ans :-\n",
    "\n",
    "# Custom exceptions :- Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you create in Python to represent specific error c\n",
    "# onditions or exceptional situations in your code. While Python provides a wide range of built-in exceptions (e.g., ValueError, ZeroDivisionError),\n",
    "# there are situations where these built-in exceptions may not precisely describe the error you want to handle. In such cases, you can define \n",
    "# your own custom exceptions to make your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why do we need custom exceptions :-\n",
    "\n",
    "# Custom exceptions in Python serve several important purposes and can greatly improve the clarity and maintainability of your code. \n",
    "# Here are some reasons why you might need custom exceptions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 1.Clarity and Readability: Custom exceptions provide meaningful names and error messages that make it easier to understand the specific \n",
    "# issue when an error occurs. This enhances code readability and helps developers quickly identify the root cause of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Distinguish Different Errors: In complex applications, you may encounter multiple types of errors or exceptional situations. Custom exceptions \n",
    "# allow you to create distinct exception classes for each type of error, making it easier to handle them appropriately. This distinguishes between \n",
    "# different error conditions and allows you to provide specific error handling logic for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Centralized Error Handling: By using custom exceptions, you can centralize the handling of specific error conditions in your code. This can \n",
    "# lead to more maintainable code because you don't scatter error-checking and handling logic throughout your program. Instead, you can handle \n",
    "# exceptions in a dedicated section of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Documentation and Self-Explanatory Code: Well-named custom exceptions serve as documentation for your code. When someone reads your code or \n",
    "# uses your library, they can understand the possible error conditions just by looking at the exception names. This makes the code self-explanatory \n",
    "# and reduces the need for extensive comments or documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Extensibility: Custom exception classes can include additional attributes or methods that carry more information about the error or perform \n",
    "# specific actions when the exception is raised. This can be especially useful when you want to provide more context about the error or implement custom error-handling behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Integration with Third-Party Libraries: When working with third-party libraries or APIs, custom exceptions can help you map and handle errors \n",
    "# specific to those external components. This allows you to create a unified error-handling strategy across your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.Testing: Custom exceptions make it easier to write unit tests for your code. You can specifically target the custom exceptions to ensure that \n",
    "# the correct exceptions are raised under different conditions.\n",
